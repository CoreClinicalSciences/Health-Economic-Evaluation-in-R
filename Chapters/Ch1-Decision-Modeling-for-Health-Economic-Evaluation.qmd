# Chapter 1 - Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation {.unnumbered}

This section of the guide presents the exercises from Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation by Andrew Briggs, Mark Sculpher, and Karl Claxton. We have translated these tasks from their original Excel format into R, providing an opportunity to practice decision modelling using a reproducible, script-based approach.

The original book is a key reference for decision modelling in health economics. While the official supporting materials are provided in other formats  
([available here](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation)), our contribution is to:

- Recreate model examples fully in R
- Translate supporting datasets and model logic into R scripts and functions
- Highlight key points from the book and show practical implementation  
- Demonstrate best practices for transparency and reproducibility in health economic modelling

## Overview of Exercises
Through these exercises, learners develop skills in writing functions, performing matrix operations, running simulations, and incorporating parameter uncertainty via probability distributions and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The exercises also introduce widely used R packages:

* `dplyr` and `tidyr` for data manipulation
* `ggplot2` for creating visualizations such as cost-effectiveness planes
* `MASS` and `MCMCpack` for probability distributions and simulation, alongside base R functions

By combining these tools, the exercises strengthen both programming fluency and applied expertise in constructing, analyzing, and interpreting health economic decision models.
