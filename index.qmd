# Introduction

Welcome to this online guidebook on health economic evaluation in R. This is a living resource, designed to grow and evolve over time as new examples, exercises, and methods are added. Our goal is to support learners, researchers, and practitioners in developing the skills needed to build and analyze health economic models directly in R.  

By working in R rather than in spreadsheets alone, analysts can take advantage of a flexible, script-based environment that enhances the transparency, reproducibility, and robustness of health economic evaluation. The guide introduces key concepts step by step, with practical exercises translated from standard texts and supplemented with modern R workflows.  

Throughout, we draw on widely used packages such as dplyr and tidyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for visualization, and tools such as MASS and MCMCpack for probability distributions and simulation. Together, these exercises and examples aim to build both technical fluency in R and a deeper understanding of best practices in health economic modelling.  

# Coding style and good practices

Good coding style is an important part of reproducible research. While individual preferences may vary, there are core elements of good practice that make code easier to read, share, and maintain. These include:  

- Using human-readable names for variables and functions  
- Writing comprehensive annotations and comments  
- Breaking code into modular, reusable functions  
- Maintaining consistent formatting and indentation  
- Keeping scripts organized and well-structured  

For those just getting started with R, we recommend following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) as a helpful reference.
