# Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation in R

This repository is a companion eBook and code collection inspired by the book *Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation* (Oxford University Press).  

Our aim is to demonstrate how health economic models can be designed, implemented, and executed entirely in R, providing a reproducible, open-source workflow.

> **Note:** This project is not affiliated with the original authors or publisher. We do not reproduce copyrighted text, figures, or tables from the book. All code and explanations here are our own work, based on concepts covered in the book.

## ðŸ“– About the Project

The original book is a key reference for decision modelling in health economics. While the official supporting materials are provided in other formats  
([available here](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation)), our contribution is to:

- Recreate model examples fully in R
- Translate supporting datasets and model logic into R scripts and functions
- Highlight key points from the book and show practical implementation  
- Demonstrate best practices for transparency and reproducibility in health economic modelling
